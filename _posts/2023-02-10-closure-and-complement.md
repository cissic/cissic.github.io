# Difference between closure and complement

For the given subset $A \in \Omega$

Let $A = <0,1)$, and $\Omega = (-\infty, \infty)$


## Complement:

[Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory))

$A' = \Omega - A$

$A' = (-\infty, 0) \cup <1, \infty)$


## Closure

[Closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(topology))

$\overline{A} = <0,1>$
