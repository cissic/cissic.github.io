# Much RAM usage at the beggining of the KDE session


<a id="orgbd01534"></a>

## Problem description

When I was working on 12 GB RAM computer and having Debian Bullseye
after logging into KDE session conky showed only about 1,5 GB
used RAM.
Now on 64GB RAM machine with Debian Testing (Trixie) after launching
KDE session conky says that around 4GB RAM is used, with the biggest
RAM demanding application - Thunderbird which requires only ~290 MB!

This started to make me worry and then I found this discussion:

<https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/why-do-i-use-so-much-ram-at-idle-debian-12-kde-4175733328/>

and this page:

<https://www.linuxatemyram.com>

I believe the explanations presented in both links make sense.
EOT.
