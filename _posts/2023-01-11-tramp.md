# TODO Remote file access - tramp mode


## Problem description

I'd like to:

1.  open an ssh session with my remote server
2.  access files that are stored on remote server
3.  edit them and execute those files as if was my machine
4.  (if the execution of the script is long I'd like to close
    the session and reopen it later)
