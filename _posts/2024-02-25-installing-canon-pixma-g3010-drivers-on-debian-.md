# TODO installing canon pixma g3010 drivers on debian

## Problem description

Canon G3010 as Wifi LAN printer used to work on
my earlier Debian however I was not able to configure it
in Debian trixie/testing.

In the end I installed local drivers with the use of
archives downloaded from here:

-   <https://ijsetupcanon.com/canon-pixma-g3000-driver-download/>

(5.30)
or here 

-   <https://canon-print.com/canon-pixma-g3010-series-drivers-windows-linux/> (5.60)

I keep them in <file:///home/mb/SEarch/Linux/Debian Drivers/Canon G3010 Pixma/>.

Still I couldn't find a way to install drivers for
network printer.
