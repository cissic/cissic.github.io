## Problem and solution

Recently some problems appeared concerning Emacs and new version of org (9.6).
First, there are some warnings about `org-assert-version` (<https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/15360>).
Another problem is related to ELPA repository (=
IMPORTANT: please install Org from GNU ELPA as Org ELPA will close before Org 9.6=).

I tried to follow some advices presented in this link:
<https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zd3l7p/org_mode_elpa_intall_invalid_function/>.
With no success.

One of the posts from the link above refers to some patch which is said to be here: 
<https://list.orgmode.org/87bkonzisl.fsf@gnu.org/T/#u>, but the page is too hard to decipher.

I don't have the time to deal with so I'll put upgrading Org off until some time and try to live with it now&#x2026;
