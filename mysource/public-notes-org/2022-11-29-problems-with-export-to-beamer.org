** Problem and solution
While working in Emacs 27.1 I encountered on a problem that comes down 
unavailability of exporting to beamer. So:
 :C-c C-e l b
didn't work.
Besides when exporting a file I got  ~unknown "nil" back-end~ error.

After many hours of searching and trying for example to exlicitely import ~ox-beamer~ which seems
to be embedded into emacs I finally found solution in the 
[[https://github.com/larstvei/ox-gfm/issues/28][internet]]. 

To solve the problem I needed to do:
#+begin_example
C-u M-x org-reload
#+end_example



# Local Variables:
# eval: (add-hook 'org-export-before-processing-hook 
# 'my/org-export-markdown-hook-function nil t)
# End:
