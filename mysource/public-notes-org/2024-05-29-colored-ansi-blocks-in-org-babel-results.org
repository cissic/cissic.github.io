** Problem description

Sometimes linux bash returns colored output, which is not
interpreted properly without additional intervention. This leads
to error while exporting to pdf.

** Solution
According to this thread:
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/44664/apply-ansi-color-escape-sequences-for-org-babel-results
everything works fine with the use of the code below: 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ek/babel-ansi ()
    (when-let ((beg (org-babel-where-is-src-block-result nil nil)))
      (save-excursion
	(goto-char beg)
	(when (looking-at org-babel-result-regexp)
	  (let ((end (org-babel-result-end))
		(ansi-color-context-region nil))
	    (ansi-color-apply-on-region beg end))))))
  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'ek/babel-ansi)
  (buffer-file-name)
#+end_src
