** Problem description
The difference is which shell gets called to evaluate your block. shell calls whatever your default shell is while sh calls /bin/sh specifically. Your default shell is probably bash, which is an extension of sh. echo $0 will tell you what executable your shell is running:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
echo $0
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: /bin/bash


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo $0
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: sh

Any of the shells in org-babel-shell-names that is installed on your system will work.
