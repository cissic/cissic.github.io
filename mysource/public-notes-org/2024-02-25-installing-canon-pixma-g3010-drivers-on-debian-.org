:END:


** Problem description
Canon G3010 as Wifi LAN printer used to work on
my earlier Debian however I was not able to configure it
in Debian trixie/testing.

In the end I installed local drivers with the use of
archives downloaded from here:
- https://ijsetupcanon.com/canon-pixma-g3000-driver-download/
(5.30)
or here 
- https://canon-print.com/canon-pixma-g3010-series-drivers-windows-linux/ (5.60)



I keep them in [[~/SEarch/Linux/Debian Drivers/Canon G3010 Pixma/]].


# Still I couldn't find a way to install drivers for
# network printer.

*** Wireless connection configuration
According to this page
https://www.cups.org/doc/network.html
I used the following command to obtain printer's URI with  so-called
=Bonjour= protocol.

#+begin_src sh :dir /sudo::
sudo lpinfo --include-schemes dnssd -v
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: network dnssd://Canon%20G3010%20series._ipp._tcp.local/?uuid=00000000-0000-1000-8000-00183b1605c2

I copied string 
~dnssd://Canon%20G3010%20series._ipp._tcp.local/?uuid=00000000-0000-1000-8000-00183b1605c2~
and pasted it as printers address choosing as a driver =Canon G3010 series, driverless, cups-filters 1.28.17=.

Wireless printer started responding...


*** Installing USB Printer

To configure printer to work as usb printer I needed to:

- install canon proprietary drivers 
#+begin_src sh :dir /sudo::
sudo apt install cups-backend-bjnp 
#+end_src

- Make: then I was able to find Canon in manufacturers list in cups
  "Add printer" menu (it was impossible earlier)

- Model: I chose =Canon PIZMA G3010 - CUPS+Gutenprint v.5.3.4 (en)=
