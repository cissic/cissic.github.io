** Problem description
Canon G3010 as Wifi LAN printer used to work on
my earlier Debian however I was not able to configure it
in Debian trixie/testing.

In the end I installed local drivers with the use of
archives downloaded from here:
- https://ijsetupcanon.com/canon-pixma-g3000-driver-download/
(5.30)
or here 
- https://canon-print.com/canon-pixma-g3010-series-drivers-windows-linux/ (5.60)



I keep them in [[~/SEarch/Linux/Debian Drivers/Canon G3010 Pixma/]].


Still I couldn't find a way to install drivers for
network printer.
