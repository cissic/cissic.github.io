# ** 
Nice feature for blocks of code that are expected to run long.

There are few packages that implement this feature.
Unfortunately ~async.el~  package does not support sessions.
On the other hand, I was not able to make [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][~ob-async~]]
and [[https://github.com/jackkamm/ob-session-async][ob-session-async]]  (which are reportedly supporting sessions)
get to work.
In the end, I found a package [[https://codeberg.org/FelipeLema/session-async.el/src/branch/main/README.md][session-async.el]], which did what was promised.
The session showing the application of ~session-async.el~ is presented below:

#+begin_src org
 
 ,#+begin_src bash :async :exports both :session sTitle
   file="Done!"
   sleep 1s
   echo "$file" 
 ,#+end_src
 
 ,#+RESULTS:
 |                                                                      |
 | mb@debi:~/projects/cissic.github.io/mysource/public-notes-org$ Done! |
 
 
 ,#+begin_src bash :exports both :session sTitle
   echo "$file"
 ,#+end_src
 
 ,#+RESULTS:
 : Done!
 
#+end_src
