** Problem description
There is a directory =~/texmf= which contains tex directory tree
structure. In order to have it usable withing =miktex= distribution
you need to
- run =miktex-console=,
- choose =Settings= -> =Directories=
- add the path to the directory to =TEXMF root directories=.
- Then it may be necessary to run
  =Tasks -> Refresh file name database=

and voila!
Now your style files and other packages should be accesible by
=miktex=.
