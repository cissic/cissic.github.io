** Problem and solution
After some Windows crashdown on dual-boot system all of the volumes mounted 
in Debian Bullseye in ~/media/user/~ changed ownership from ~user~ to ~root~. 
In order to solve the problem I followed [[https://serverfault.com/a/39308][Saurabh Barjatiya's post]].
His approach didn't succeed at first -- while trying to run proposed commands
system responded with:

#+begin_example
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)
Could not mount read-write, trying read-only
The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)
#+end_example

I bypassed this error with 
[[https://askubuntu.com/a/566381][Muddassir Nazir's solution]], which was said to be risky for Windows system,
but at the time of writing this I didn't care about it -- I hadn't booted 
Windows for a very long time anyway.
