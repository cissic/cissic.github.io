*** Problem - introduction
Let's say we've got the following org file

#+begin_src org :tangle (concat (org-entry-get nil "PRJ-DIR" t) "Ex1.org") :mkdirp yes :exports both
  ,* Headline 1 with name taken from properties - src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name")}
  :PROPERTIES:
  :Name:  J.S. Bach
  :END:
      
  ,** SubHeadline 
#+end_src

Since properties are not inherited by default
we cannot add =src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name")}= in the subheadline.

But we can turn the properties inheritance on, and then it is possible
to export the following piece of code (Do observe
the usage of ='selective= flag - without it the example wouldn't work!):

#+begin_src org :tangle (concat (org-entry-get nil "PRJ-DIR" t) "Ex2.org") :mkdirp yes :exports both
  # -*- mode: Org; org-use-property-inheritance: t -*- 
  ,* Headline 1 with name taken from properties - src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name")}
  :PROPERTIES:
  :Name:  J.S. Bach
  :END:

  ,** SubHeadline  - src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name" 'selective)}
#+end_src


*** Problem - question
Now I would like to keep properties in a different file. Let's call
the file "properties.txt" and let it have the following content:

#+begin_src text :tangle (concat (org-entry-get nil "PRJ-DIR" t) "properties.txt") :mkdirp yes :exports both
  :PROPERTIES:
  :Name:  Newman
  :END:
#+end_src 

Is it possible to these properties being inherited like in the example above?


**** Approach 1 - failure
This won't work:
#+begin_src org :tangle (concat (org-entry-get nil "PRJ-DIR" t) "Ex3.org") :mkdirp yes :exports both
  # -*- mode: Org; org-use-property-inheritance: t -*- 
  ,* Headline 1 with name taken from properties - src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name")}
  #+INCLUDE: ./properties.txt

  ,** SubHeadline  - src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name" 'selective)}
#+end_src

**** Approach 2
This does work but it's less convenient:
#+begin_src org :tangle (concat (org-entry-get nil "PRJ-DIR" t) "Ex4.org") :mkdirp yes :exports both
  # -*- mode: Org; org-use-property-inheritance: t -*- 
  ,* Headline 1 with name taken from properties - src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name")}
  ,#+INCLUDE: ./properties.txt

  ,** SubHeadline  - src_elisp{(org-entry-get nil "Name" 'selective)}
  #+INCLUDE: ./properties.txt
#+end_src
