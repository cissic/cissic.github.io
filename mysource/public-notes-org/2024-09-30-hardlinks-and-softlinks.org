** Hard link
Hard link:
#+begin_src shell
echo "111" > test.txt
ln test.txt hlinkToTest
rm -rf test.txt
cat hlinkToTest
#+end_src

Hardlink links to the content of the file. You can access content
until the very last of the hard links exist.

#+begin_example
Hard link       OriginalFilename (test.txt)
    \          /
    _\|      |/_
        Inode
       878945
          |
	  |
	 \|/
    Data on Hard Drive	 

#+end_example

** Soft link
#+begin_src shell
echo "111" > test.txt
ln test.txt slinkToTest
rm -rf test.txt
cat slinkToTest
#+end_src
Does to work because slinkToTest linked to test.txt name, not to the
file content itself.


Softlink links to other filename, not to content itself.
Soft link can't access the content of riginalFilename if
OriginalFilename is deleted.

#+begin_example
