info: downloading installer
Welcome to Julia!

This will download and install the official Julia Language distribution
and its version manager Juliaup.

Juliaup will be installed into the Juliaup home directory, located at:

  /home/mb/.juliaup

The julia, juliaup and other commands will be added to
Juliaup's bin directory, located at:

  /home/mb/.juliaup/bin

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

  /home/mb/.bashrc
  /home/mb/.profile

Julia will look for a new version of Juliaup itself every 1440 minutes when you start julia.

You can uninstall at any time with juliaup self uninstall and these
changes will be reverted.
