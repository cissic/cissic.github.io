* Adding privileges to directory for non-root user

:END:

** Problem description
Let's imagine we want to give non-root user access to root directory.
Let it be =/var/lib/docker/volumes/=.

The easiest approach is as follows:

*** Install =acl= package
#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt install acl
#+end_src

With the commands from this package we may easily view and edit
privileges to files/directories

*** Add privileges to =/var/lib/docker/=
By adding privileges only to =/var/lib/docker/volumes= we wouldn't
have access to it anyway because we would be blocked at
=/var/lib/docker/= level, so we need to give access to this directory.
Note that we do not use ~-R~ modifier because:
1) we don't want user has access to all that is inside =docker/=
2) with ~-R~ evaluating this command may take very looooong

#+begin_src bash
  cd /var/lib/
  sudo setfacl -m u:USERNAME:rwx docker/
#+end_src

*** Add _recursively_ privileges to =/var/lib/docker/volumes=

Now we do use  ~-R~ modifier:
#+begin_src bash
  sudo setfacl -R -m u:USERNAME:rwx volumes/
#+end_src

Now we can...

*** Inspect directory access control list
#+begin_src bash
  getfacl /var/lib/docker/volumes/
#+end_src
