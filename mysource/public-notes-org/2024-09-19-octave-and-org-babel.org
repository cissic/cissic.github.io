** How to get the functionality of showing octave figures like in GUI
Running plot command without starting session, ends up in
closing figure window before anything is shown - Octave closess
immediately.
#+begin_src octave 
close all
h = figure,
plot([0 1], [0 1])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

On the other hand, when the block is run in the context of some
session like below
#+begin_src octave :session *MatOct* 
h = figure,
plot([0 1], [0 1])
#+end_src
it is impossible to close the figure window with 'X' button, 

The circumvent for this bug can be 
#+begin_src octave :session *MatOct* 
close all
h = figure,
plot([0 1], [0 1])
#+end_src
but, this way or another, the last figure will last until
=close= command is not run from octave command line.
If the session is killed the figure still remains opened.
