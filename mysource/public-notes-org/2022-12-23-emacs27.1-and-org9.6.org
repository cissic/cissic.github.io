** Problem: Installing org 9.6 in Debian Bullseye's Emacs 27.1
In my Debian Bullseye's Emacs 27.1 a built-in org version is 9.3.
Since I wanted to test new ~org-cite~ library which is built-in
in 9.6 I needed to upgrade ~org~.

Things didn't go smoothly. My ~install-package.el~ script couldn't handle
that and all in all I was forced to perform in manually, still not
without some problems.

*** Solution
After ~M-x list-packages~ I found on Melpa (~package-initialize~ might be
needed)
required version of org, namely 9.6.1.
Clicking on button "Install" didn't work due to some errors.
So the solution is to conduct package installation on bare Emacs instance
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zd3l7p/org_mode_elpa_intall_invalid_function/][Link]]. You need to start Emacs with ~-Q~ modifier:
#+begin_src
  emacs -Q
#+end_src
then ~M-x list-packages~ and installing by clicking "Install" button
should go smoothly.
Then you just need to start Emacs normally with your ~init~ file
and everything should be fine.



** [DEPRECATED - First Attempt] Problem and solution
Recently some problems appeared concerning Emacs and new version of org (9.6).
First, there are some warnings about ~org-assert-version~ (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/15360).
Another problem is related to ELPA repository (=
IMPORTANT: please install Org from GNU ELPA as Org ELPA will close before Org
9.6=).

I tried to follow some advices presented in this link:
https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zd3l7p/org_mode_elpa_intall_invalid_function/.
With no success.

One of the posts from the link above refers to some patch which is said to be here: 
https://list.orgmode.org/87bkonzisl.fsf@gnu.org/T/#u, but the page is too hard to
decipher.

I don't have the time to deal with so I'll put upgrading Org off until some time
and try to live with it now...
