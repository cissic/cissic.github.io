** Problem description
I had a high CPU usage by Kactivitymanagerd and plasmashell.

After performing the actions described here:
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/high-cpu-usage-from-plasmashell-kactivitymanagerd/114305

which came down to :
#+begin_src sh
  cp ~/.local/share/kactivitymanagerd/resources/ ~/.local/share/kactivitymanagerd/resourcesBKP
  rm -rf /home/.local/share/kactivitymanagerd/resources/
#+end_src
the problem stopped.

After some time you may of course delete backupped directory:
#+begin_src sh
  rm -rf /home/.local/share/kactivitymanagerd/resourcesBKP/
#+end_src

#+begin_src org :tangle (concat (org-entry-get nil "PRJ-DIR" t) "script.org") :mkdirp yes :exports none :results none

#+end_src
