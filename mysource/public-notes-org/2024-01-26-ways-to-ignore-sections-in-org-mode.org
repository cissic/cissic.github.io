** Problem description
There are several ways of ignoring/not including section in org-mode
document:

1. =noexport= tag
   Prevents exporting section (org-babel source block will be executed
   during export).
   
2. =:ignore:= tag
  Section content will be included in the final document,
  however the headline will be ignored (inside the document and in toc)
  (org-babel source block will be executed during export).
  
3. =:UNNUMBERED:= property:
   After adding:
   #+begin_src org
     ,* Section 1                   :noexport:
     ,:PROPERTIES:
     ,:UNNUMBERED: t
     ,:END:
  
     This section will not be included in the TOC.
  
     ,** Subsection 1
     Some content here.
   
     ,** Subsection 2
     More content here.
   #+end_src

   Now, when you generate the TOC using `C-c C-c` on the TOC headline
   or by running the command `M-x org-update-statistics-cookies`,
   "Section 1" will not be included, but the subsections will still
   appear in the TOC.
